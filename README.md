# CPP
Details about the project:
1. The application is created in CPP.
2. It uses MySQL server.
3. It has 3 projects
    i.) The front-end part, which shows the details to the user and takes the input.
    ii.) The middle API, which is the mediator between front-end and backend.
   iii.) The backend, which interact with the database to perform required action.
4. I have kept the project as simple as possible but also tolerant to cope with wrong  input values
5. Added comment for all the methods.
6. I have tested on my level considering all the possible options but might have missed something.
7. As I had installed x64 MySQL version, I compiled the project only in x64 bit.
8. Few warnings are reported due to exporting STL classes. I ignored them.
